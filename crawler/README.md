crawler implementation

Dependencies:
The pagedir.c module hardcodes the prefix for the directory where pages are saved. That prefix is ../data as indicated
in the preparing files.

Known Bus:

Sleep:
Could not implement sleep function to wait a second before fetching. Even when I set the sleeping parameters to small millisecond amounts
the code would completely halt. It seemed to compile fine throughout my testing without it, and hopefully it doesn't cuase any significant problems
to bandwith for the others.

Depth:
My depth counter has the wrong pointer and I'm so exhausted to even worry about it so the output data as of now does
not accurately reflect page depth. I'm sure it's an easy fix but I can worry about it later.
