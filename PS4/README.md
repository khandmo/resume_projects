## Graphs and Maps in Java

This program uses breadth first search to find the closest "path" between actors. It trains from a large
set of actors (vertices) and the movies they share (directed lines) then, according to user input, creates
a bfs graph with the actor chosen as the root. The program can then compute the closest path between another
user input actor.
