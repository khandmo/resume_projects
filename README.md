# Resume projects

## Nuggets game (C)

The Nuggets game was a group project which required the students to create a playable game
in which the user quests to collect as much "gold" (labeled as asterisks) in a given
initialized map. The game is multiplayer and accepts up to 24 players and one spectator,
with the winner of game having collected the most gold. I personally implemented the gameClient
and display folders in the game files.

## Tiny Search Engine (C)

The Tiny Search Engine is a collection of multiple labs: crawler, indexer, and querier. They
work in tandom to crawl Dartmouth webpages and index the word frequency in each page so that
a user can query a word or combination of words using "and" and/or "or" to give a tier list
of pages with the most frequent uses of the queried words.

## PS4 (Java)

### The Kevin Bacon Game

The Kevin Bacon Game utilizes a breadth first search algorithm to find the closest "path" 
on a graph of movies associated between two actors, and both are input from the user.

## PS5 (Java)

### The Sudi Assistant

The imaginary Sudi Assitant will need a way to discern speech patterns. The program trains a
map based on observations from input sentences and each word's associated part of speech (noun,
verb, adjective, etc.). It then takes more input sentences without associated tags and uses
Viterbi decoding to infer and print a best guess of associated tags. The program is then 
fed the correct tags and matches each tag to print the overall accuracy of the program.
