## Nuggets game

The Nuggets game was a group project which required the students to create a playable game
in which the user quests to collect as much "gold" (labeled as asterisks) in a given
initialized map. The game is multiplayer and accepts up to 24 players and one spectator,
with the winner of game having collected the most gold. I personally implemented the gameClient
and display folders in the game files.

## Tiny Search Engine

The Tiny Search Engine is a collection of multiple labs: crawler, indexer, and querier. They
work in tandom to crawl Dartmouth webpages and index the word frequency in each page so that
a user can query a word or combination of words using "and" and/or "or" to give a tier list
of pages with the most frequent uses of the queried words.
