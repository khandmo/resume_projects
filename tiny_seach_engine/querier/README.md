##CS50 Tiny Search Engine

Querier allows for functionality such that a user may search the crawled Dartmouth webpages
for words (no numbers, more than three letters). One may also utilize "and" (or implicitly
a space between two queries) and/or "or" to group queries and search for intersections/unions
of sets of webpages respectively.
