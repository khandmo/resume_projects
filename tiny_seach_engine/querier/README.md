QUERIER README

******** THIS ASSIGNMENT USES BOTH LAB EXTENSIONS *****************

Describe assumptions made while writing, and known bugs
Indicate how much functionality was implemented

As of the first deadline, querier does not work as anticpated, though
the bulk of the code has been written and bug fixes are being made.
I haven't even had it stable enough to run through valgrind yet.

As of the sunday deadline, querier works as anticipated with NO
memory leaks. ALL functionality is implemented: scoring, and/or precedence,
the whole 9 yards. The only 'issue' is that of erroneous spaces between
words, which throws things off.

My testing campaign DOES NOT work, and I followed the syntax from the
page which reccommends how to give the program input from a file.

That being said, I've included the testing files I attempted to make work
in the commit, and if you attempt those yourself, you'll see the program can
handle it, excluding the invalid pageDirectory case (more details in the
testing file).
